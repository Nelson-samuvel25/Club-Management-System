National Policy for Women Empowerment for Socio-economic Development </h1>
<div class="mt-4">
<p>The empowerment of women is a socio-political ideal envisioned concerning the wider framework for the rights of women. It is a way that leads women to realize their full potential, their rights to have access to opportunities, resources, and choices with the freedom of decision-making both within and outside the home. National policy for women empowerment would be achieved only when advancement in women’s conditions is accompanied by their ability to influence the direction of social change gained through equal opportunities in economic, social, and political spheres of life.</p>
<h2>National policy for Women Empowerment Socially</h2>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="640" height="686" src="./women_development_club_files/National-policy-for-Women-Empowerment-Socially.png" alt="National policy for Women Empowerment Socially" class="wp-image-440" srcset="https://hindrise.org/resources/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/National-policy-for-Women-Empowerment-Socially.png 640w, https://hindrise.org/resources/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/National-policy-for-Women-Empowerment-Socially-280x300.png 280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></figure>
<h3>Proper Education</h3>
<p>It is ensured that equal access to education is provided for all women and girls. Special measures can be taken to eliminate discrimination, universalize education, eradicate illiteracy, create a gender-sensitive educational system, increase enrolment and retention rates of girls and improve the quality of education to facilitate lifelong learning as the development of occupation and technical skills by women. Reducing a gender gap in secondary and higher education would will a focus area. The existing policy targets will be achieved, with a special focus on girls and women, particularly those belonging to weaker sections, including the Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes/Other Backward Classes/Minorities.</p>
<h3>Health improvement</h3>
<p>A holistic approach to women’s health includes nutrition and health services requiring special attention to women at all life cycle stages. The reduction in maternal mortality and infant mortality is a priority concern and is another sensitive indicator of human development. The national policy for <a href="https://hindrise.org/women-empowerment">women empowerment</a> reiterates the national demographic goals for Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR), Infant Mortality Rate (IMR), set out in the National Population Policy. Women must have an access to comprehensive, affordable, and quality health care. Hence, measures must be adopted that take into account women’s reproductive rights to enable them to exercise the informed choices, their vulnerability to sexual &amp; health-related problems together with infectious, endemic, and hypertension as well as communicable diseases, water-borne diseases, and also cardiopulmonary diseases. The health consequences of HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases will be tackled from a gender perspective.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="640" height="639" src="./women_development_club_files/National-Policy-for-Women-Empowerment-Economically.png" alt="National Policy for Women Empowerment Economically" class="wp-image-439" srcset="https://hindrise.org/resources/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/National-Policy-for-Women-Empowerment-Economically.png 640w, https://hindrise.org/resources/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/National-Policy-for-Women-Empowerment-Economically-300x300.png 300w, https://hindrise.org/resources/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/National-Policy-for-Women-Empowerment-Economically-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></figure>
<h3>Poverty Eradication</h3>
<p>The women comprise hence the majority of the population is below the poverty line and are very often in extreme poverty situations. The harsh reality of intra-household &amp; social discrimination, macroeconomic policies,, and poverty eradication programs will specifically address such women’s needs and problems. There will be an improved implementation of programs which are already women-oriented with special targets for women. Therefore, steps have been taken to mobilize poor women and convergence of services by offering them a range of economical options and necessary support measures to enhance their capabilities.</p>
<h3>Providing Micro Credit</h3>
<p>In order to enhance the women’s access to credit for consumption and production, an establishment of new and strengthening of existing micro-credit mechanisms and micro-finance institutions will be undertaken so that the outreach of credit is provided to needy. Other supportive measures have been taken under the National policy for women empowerment to ensure an adequate credit flow through extant financial institutions and banks. All women below the poverty line have an easy access to credit.</p>
<h3>Women and Economy</h3>
<p>Women’s perspectives must be included in designing and implementing macro-economic and social policies by institutionalizing their participation in processes. The contribution to socio-economic development as producers and workers will be recognized in the formal and informal sectors (including home-based workers), and appropriate employment policies and working conditions for her will be drawn up.</p>
<h3>Globalization</h3>
<p>Globalization has presented new challenges for realizing the goal of women’s equality, the gender impact of which has not been systematically evaluated fully. However, from the micro-level studies commissioned by the Department of Women &amp; Child Development, it is evident that there is a need for re-framing policies for access to employment and employment quality. Benefits of the growing global economy have been unevenly distributed, leading to wider economic disparities, the feminization of poverty, increased gender inequality through often deteriorating working conditions, and unsafe working environments, especially in the informal economy and rural areas. Strategies have been designed to enhance women’s capacity and empower them to meet the negative social and economic impacts, which may flow from the globalization process.</p>
<h3>Women and Agriculture</h3>
<p>The women’s critical role in the agriculture and allied sectors, as producers, concentrated efforts have been made to ensure that benefits of training, extension, and various programs will reach them in proportion to their numbers. The national policy for women empowerment is for training women in soil conservation, social forestry, dairy development, and other occupations allied to agriculture like horticulture, livestock including small animal husbandry, poultry, fisheries, etc., will be expanded to benefit women workers in the agriculture sector.</p>
<h3>Women and Industry</h3>
<p>The important roles of women in electronics, information technology and food processing and agro-industry, and textiles have been crucial to developing these sectors. This will provide comprehensive support in terms of labor legislation, social security, and other support services to participate in various industrial sectors. Women at present cannot work a night shift in factories even if they wish to. Suitable measures have been taken to enable women to work on the night shift in factories. Support services provide for security, transportation, etc.</p>
<h3>Support Services</h3>
<p>The support services for women, like child care facilities, including crèches at workplaces and educational institutions, homes for the aged and the disabled, has been expanded and improved to create an enabling environment and ensure their full cooperation in society, political, and economic life. Women-friendly personnel policies have been drawn up to encourage women to participate effectively in the developmental process.</p>

<h3>Violence against Women</h3>
<p>All forms of violence against women, either physical and mental, whether at domestic or societal levels, including those arising from customs, traditions, or accepted practices, must be dealt with effectively to eliminate its incidence. The Institutions and mechanisms/schemes for assistance have been created to strengthened and prevent such violence, including sexual harassment at the workplace and customs such as dowry, the rehabilitation facility for victims of violence, etc. A special emphasis has been laid on programs and measures to deal with trafficking in women and girls.</p>
<h3>Rights of the Girl Child</h3>
<p>All forms of discrimination against the girl child and violation of her rights have been eliminated by undertaking strong preventive and punitive measures within and outside the family. These would relate specifically to strict enforcement of laws against prenatal sex selection and female infanticide practices, female infanticide, child marriage, child abuse, child prostitution, etc. Removal of discrimination in the girl child’s treatment within the family and outside and projection of a positive image of the girl child will be actively fostered.</p>
